I'm an experienced software engineer specializing in gameplay and iOS development. Previously, I was a features engineer on the hit mobile game [Disney Emoji Blitz][emojiBlitz]. Before that, I founded Planetary Gaming, which was selected for the highly competitive [StartupUCLA Accelerator][startupUCLA] and the Barry Eggers seed prize.

I am a lifelong learner and am always looking for the next project that will help me become a more well-rounded developer.

**Skills:** C#, C++, Swift, Objective-C, Unity, SwiftUI, SOLID Design, Test Driven Development, Git, Algorithms, 3D Math.
