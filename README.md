Hi, I’m @nickpfister.

I'm a game developer specializing in Unity and mobile. I work as a software engineer at Jam City.

In my free time, I like working on fitness apps and expanding my knowledge of 3D games. Right now, I'm learning native iOS and working on an open source running app. I plan to release this sometime in 2021.
