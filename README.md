Hi, I’m @nickpfister.

I'm a game developer specializing in Unity and mobile.

My top languages are C# and Swift. Though my main focus is in improving my existing skillset, I'm also interested in C++ (for a better understanding of game engines), Objective C (for a better understanding of iOS and MacOS environments), and Blender (for a better understanding of the 3D art pipeline).
